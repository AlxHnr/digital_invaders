A game based on notes and sketches we made during class. This game is very
punishing, but can be beaten every time once you _learn_ the way the
enemies behave. A full run takes about 15 minutes. The top-left corner of
the screen contains a health bar and a point counter. Checkout the other
branches for extras.
